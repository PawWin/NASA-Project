            <h2>Cameras Diagrams</h2>
            <p>Chart of the number of photos taken by cameras used by Mars rovers.
                Here are characteristics of some of them:

    1. FHAZ (Front Hazard Avoidance Camera): is a pair of cameras positioned at the front of the rover, used for navigation and obstacle avoidance. These cameras aid in identifying potential hazards on the rover's path.

    2. RHAZ (Rear Hazard Avoidance Camera): consists of cameras located at the back of the rover, serving a similar purpose to FHAZ but directed towards the rear of the rover. They assist in avoiding obstacles during rover reversals.

    3. MAST (Mast Camera) is an advanced set of cameras mounted on the rover's mast, which can be rotated. These cameras provide high-quality landscape images and are used for scientific purposes as well as for rover movement planning.

    4. MAHLI (Mars Hand Lens Imager) is a camera mounted on the rover's robotic arm, capable of approaching the surface and capturing very close-up images. It is used for the analysis of mineralogy and rock structure.

    5. NAVCAM (Navigation Camera) is a set of cameras used for navigation and determining the rover's location on the surface of Mars. They assist in determining the position and orientation of the rover.
